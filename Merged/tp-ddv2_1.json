Each record captures detailed information about a specific security finding, enabling risk assessment, prioritization, and remediation tracking.\n\n## Each Finding Record Contains:\n\n**Identity Information**\n- Unique identifier (p_id) serving as the primary key for each finding\n- Human-readable display label that describes the finding in user-friendly terms\n- Type classification categorizing the finding (Software Vulnerability, Control Gap, Threat Detection)\n- Origin data identifying the source systems that discovered the issue (AWS, CrowdStrike, MS Azure, etc.)\n- Count of origin showing how many different data sources contributed to the finding\n\n**Risk Assessment Data**\n- Exposure severity rating (Critical, High, Medium, Low) indicating risk-based classification\n- Numerical exposure score quantifying overall risk level based on impact and likelihood\n- Likelihood/criticality score (0-1000) assessing probability of exploitation\n- Assessment severity rating showing importance of the associated security assessment\n- Exposure weightage determining how much this finding contributes to overall scoring\n\n**Temporal Information**\n- First found date marking initial discovery during data ingestion\n- First seen date showing earliest observation across all data sources\n- Last updated date indicating most recent modification to any attribute\n- Last found date showing most recent observation during data ingestion\n- Last active date indicating most recent active detection in the environment\n- Reopened date (when applicable) showing when a previously closed finding recurred\n- Activity status (Active/Inactive) reflecting current detection state\n- Lifetime metrics measuring duration between first seen and last active dates\n- Recent activity tracking days since the finding was last observed\n- Observed lifetime calculating duration between first and last found dates\n- Recency measuring days since last discovery during data ingestion\n\n**Status and Lifecycle Data**\n- Remediation status (Open/Closed) showing current state of issue resolution\n- Contributing module indicating which system components use this finding (Exposure, Reporting, or both)\n\n**Descriptive Content**\n- Detailed finding evidence explaining the security issue, context, and potential impact\n- Failure reasons specifying which rules or conditions were violated\n- Assessment title naming the security evaluation that generated the finding\n\n**Scope and Context**\n- Scope definition outlining evaluation boundaries for the finding\n- Exposure category classifying the type of security issue\n- Data source subset names identifying specific API endpoints providing finding data\n\nThis rich dataset enables security teams to identify, prioritize, and remediate vulnerabilities based on severity, status, recency, and affected assets. The table supports sophisticated queries for security posture assessment, compliance verification, and risk management across the organization's technology environment.",
      "navigator_graph_node_description": "The Finding entity represents identified security issues within an organization's environment, including vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, compliance gaps, and control weaknesses. It captures key attributes such as finding title, description, status (open/closed), severity level, and associated assessment information. Security attributes include exposure severity, likelihood scores, vulnerability metrics derived from CVSS ratings, and contribution to overall security posture. Findings are linked to affected assets across the infrastructure and maintain lifecycle information from first discovery through remediation or closure. This entity enables prioritization of security efforts through risk-based scoring that considers both the severity of issues and the exposure level of affected assets.",
      "navigator_entity_description": "\nA Finding is a specific piece of information that indicates a potential security issue or anomaly within an organization's IT infrastructure, systems, applications, processes, or operations. Findings represent the actionable output of security assessments and evaluations. \n\nAs the assessment fails, a finding is generated for an asset. \nThe following are the list of assessments and the corresponding findings:\n\nTitle of the security assessment ==> Associated finding title                        \n1.'Devices do not have vulnerabilities related to expired SSL certificates'==> 'Expired SSL certificates'\n2.'Devices do not have password related vulnerabilities'==> 'Device has password-related vulnerabilities'\n3.'Devices employ full-disk encryption'==> 'Full disk encryption not enforced'\n4.'Devices have endpoint protection signatures frequently updated'==> 'Outdated EDR signatures'\n5.'Devices are regularly reconciled in the appropriate CMDB'==> 'CMDB reconciliation failed'\n6.'Devices have firewall protection enabled'==> 'Host firewall disabled'\n7.'Devices are recorded in the appropriate CMDB'==> 'Asset not in CMDB'\n8.'Devices have endpoint protection agents onboarded'==>'Missing EDR agent'\n9.'Devices have a single assigned owner'==> 'Ownership conflict'\n10.'Devices are scanned for malicious code at the defined frequency'==>'Malware scan overdue'\n11.'Devices enforce blocking of known malware'==>'Malware blocking disabled'\n12.'Devices follow approved naming conventions'==>'Inconsistent asset naming'\n13.'Devices have an accountable owner'==> 'Unaccountable devices'\n14.'Windows devices are configured with right User Account Control (UAC)'==> 'UAC Misconfigured' \n15.'Software vulnerabilities on internal devices are remediated within SLA'==>'CVE-XXXX-XXXX'\n16.'Software vulnerabilities on network devices are remediated within SLA'==>'CVE-XXXX-XXXX'\n17.'Software vulnerabilities on external devices are remediated within SLA'==>'CVE-XXXX-XXXX'\n\nfor software vulnerabilities, the corresponding finding title is the CVE ID.\n\nThe Finding entity contains essential details about identified security concerns, their nature, severity, and remediation status. It includes attributes such as display label, detailed description, current status (open/closed), first found date, and last updated date. Each finding is classified by type (such as Software Vulnerability, Control Gap, or Misconfiguration) and categorized based on exposure category.  \n\nSecurity-related attributes provide context for risk prioritization. These include exposure severity ratings (Critical to Low), likelihood assessments, vulnerability severity derived from standards like CVSS, and numerical scoring metrics that quantify risk levels. Findings maintain temporal information tracking their lifecycle from discovery through remediation, including status changes and reopening events if vulnerabilities reoccur.  \n\nFindings are directly connected to affected assets within the organization's environment, creating relationships between security issues and the infrastructure components they impact. This connection enables effective remediation planning and risk management.  \n\nThe Finding entity aggregates information from various security tools, vulnerability scanners, compliance frameworks, and cloud security platforms, offering a comprehensive view of security posture across the organization.  \n\nIn addition, the Finding entity includes specific quantitative attributes:  \n\n- Count of Origin: The total count of data sources that contributed to the identification of the finding.  \n- Exposure Score: Numerical value quantifying the risk level of the finding based on asset impact and exploitation likelihood.  \n- Likelihood Score: Numerical value (0-1000) assessing the probability of exploitation based on vulnerability severity and asset exposure factors.  \n- Recent Activity: Number of days since the finding was last updated or observed in the environment.  \n    - When a user queries for maximum, minimum, highest, lowest, or filtered values (e.g., greater than or less than) related to the above quantitative attributes, results should focus only on the Finding entity without including other entities for that specific part of the query. However, for other aspects of the query, additional entities may be included as needed. \n    - The above quantitative attributes should not be used when calculating the total count of findings to avoid redundancy and we dont have *sum* operation support.\n\t\n\n",

By maintaining structured data on vulnerabilities, security teams can:  \\n\\n- **Prioritize threats** based on severity and exploitability.  \\n- **Track mitigation efforts** to ensure timely risk reduction.  \\n- **Align with compliance** frameworks to meet regulatory standards.  \\n- **Gain threat intelligence** on actively exploited vulnerabilities.  \\n\\nThis table is an essential component of cybersecurity risk management, providing a **centralized view of vulnerabilities** to enhance an organization's security posture.\\n\\nAdditionally,Vulenrability table contains below details for each Vulnerability\\n- **associated_hosts_with_findings_count (without filter,becase there is so many categories like this only give sum of all)**: The count of hosts/machines/devices affected by vulenrability(open/closed),this field will give how many hosts/machines/devices are affected by that vulenrability(open/closed)\\n- **associated_hosts_with_open_findings_count (without filter,becase there is so many categories like this only give sum of all)**: The number of hosts/machines/devices which have that vulnerability currently open/unresolved, this field will give in how many hosts that vulnerability remains open/unresolved\\n- **associated_application_with_findings_count**: The count of applications/softwares which have that vulenrability(open/closed)\\n    - if user asking about max/high/largest min/least/lower or filter like less than greater than of above return Vulenrability only, dont take above additional attribute for get total count of hosts/applications because redundancy and we dont have *sum* support\\n",

Digital Identification:\\nAn Identity is uniquely recognized in digital systems by authentication-related attributes, such as:\\n\\nExamples: aad_object_id, sam_account_name, oauth_client_id, User Principal Name (UPN), AAD Device ID.\\nNot Included: HR identifiers such as employee ID, job title, department, or business unit.\\n2. Classification:\\nIdentities are categorized based on system-level properties, such as:\\n\\nType: Human vs. Non-Human (e.g., service accounts, applications, IoT devices).\\nFormat: Cloud-based, on-premises, federated identity, machine accounts.\\nNot Included: Employment status, organizational roles, or reporting structures.\\n3. Authentication & Authorization:\\nAttributes related to verifying and controlling system access, including:\\n\\nAuthentication: Multi-factor authentication (MFA) status, sign-in activity (e.g., successful/failed logins).\\nAuthorization: Access roles, privileges, sign-in frequency, access across locations.\\nNot Included: Employee job roles, HR-related access policies, or employment history.\\n4. Lifecycle Tracking:\\nTracking an identity\\u2019s presence within systems, such as:\\n\\nIncluded: Account creation date, last active timestamp, operational status, expiration policies.\\nNot Included: Hire/termination dates, job transfers, or HR system records.\\n5. Risk Assessment & Security Monitoring:\\nSecurity aspects related to identity usage and authentication, such as:\\n\\nIncluded: Risk scores (e.g., MFA risk score), anomaly detection, exposure levels, unauthorized access attempts.\\nNot Included: Department-based risk profiling, employment risk analysis, or business unit compliance.\\n6. Integration with Identity Providers:\\nIdentity spans across various authentication platforms, including:\\n\\nExamples: Azure AD (AAD ID), Active Directory (Distinguished Name), AWS IAM (Role ARN).\\nNot Included: HR systems, personnel management platforms, or employee data repositories.\\nCommon Ways Identity Is Referred To:\\nBy non-technical users: \\'login,\\' \\'username,\\' \\'computer account.\\'\\nBy IT staff: \\'IAM entity,\\' \\'machine identity,\\' \\'service account.\\'\\nBy cybersecurity professionals: \\'authentication principal,\\' \\'privileged account.\\'\\nPlatform-specific terms: \\'Azure AD user,\\' \\'AWS IAM role.\\'\\nKey Differentiation from the Person Entity:\\nIdentity focuses solely on system access and authentication, while Person relates to employment details, organizational roles, and asset ownership.\\n\\nQueries relevant to Identity must center around access control and authentication, NOT employment or organizational affiliations.\\n\\nQueries Relevant to Identity (Examples):\\n\\'Disabled identities in MS Active Directory with recent activity.\\'\\n\\'Identities without MFA enrollment.\\'\\n\\'List of privileged accounts in Azure AD.\\'\\n\\'Service accounts that have accessed multiple systems recently.\\'\\n\\nKey Exclusions from Identity Entity:\\nTo ensure accurate classification, the following aspects should NOT be considered part of the Identity entity:\\n\\nEmployment details: Employee ID, job title, department, reporting manager.\\nOrganizational hierarchy: Business units, cost centers, reporting structures.\\nAsset ownership: Devices or resources assigned to individuals.\\nLocation or company-specific attributes: Physical location, company affiliation.\\nUser status in HR systems: Employment termination, contract types, department membership.\\n\\nAdditionally the table contains\\n**has_account_count**:Number of accounts linked to the identity\\n",

Queries related to the following topics should be classified under Person, NOT Identity:\\n    \\n    Employment-related queries: Job title, department, employment status, and historical employment records.\\n    Asset ownership: Devices assigned to individuals, their responsibility over resources.\\n    Organizational structure: Reporting lines, department affiliation, and business units.\\n    Work history: Tracking former employees and their past interactions.\\n    Compliance and HR tracking: Employee onboarding/offboarding, adherence to security policies.\\n    \\n\\n    To prevent confusion with Identity, the following aspects are NOT part of the Person entity:\\n    \\n    Authentication and authorization: MFA setup, login credentials, access roles, permissions.\\n    Sign-in behavior: Last login timestamps, account lockout events, anomalous sign-in detection.\\n    IAM-related queries: Azure AD, AWS IAM, and related access management platforms.\\n    Device vulnerabilities and host-based security assessments.\\n    IMPORTANT:Active users in a directory service mean Person entity\\n\\n    Additionally,Person table contains below details for each Person/Employee/Owner/Indivitual\\n    - **owns_host_count (without filter,becase there is so many categories this only give sum of all)**: The count of hosts/machines/devices associated/owned by a Person/Employee/Owner/Indivitual,this field will give how many hosts/machines/devices are associated with a Person/Employee/Owner/Indivitual\\n    - **has_identity_count (without filter,becase there is so many categories like active,inavtive this only give sum of all)**: The number of identities associated with a Person/Employee/Owner/Indivitual, this field will give how many identities are associated with a Person/Employee/Owner/Indivitual\\n    - if user asking about max/high/largest min/least/lower or filter like less than greater than of above (host count/identity count of person) return Person only, dont take above additional attribute for get total count of owners/identities because redundancy\\n        - When a user queries for maximum, minimum, highest, lowest, or filtered values (e.g., greater than or less than) related to the above quantitative attributes, results should focus only on the Person entity without including other entities for that specific part of the query. However, for other aspects of the query, additional entities may be included as needed. \\n        - The above quantitative attributes should not be used when calculating the total count of hosts or identities to avoid redundancy and we dont have *sum* operation support",

It provides a systematic approach to identifying vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, and control gaps with detailed information about evaluation criteria, severity classifications, and scope definitions.\n\n## Data Categories\n\n### Identity & Classification\n- **Assessment Identifiers**: Unique IDs and reference codes (e.g., AST-01-01)\n- **Assessment Titles**: Descriptive names identifying each security evaluation\n- **Type Classification**: Categories like Endpoint Exposure, Software Exposure\n- **Origin Details**: Data sources required for conducting assessments (AWS, MS Azure, etc.)\n\n### Descriptive Content\n- **Assessment Description**: Comprehensive explanations of evaluation objectives and benefits\n- **Display Labels**: Derived identifiers for referencing assessments\n- **Scope Validation Steps**: Specifies the validation steps of the assessment that is used to evaluate success/failure\n- **Scope Entity**: Specifies the entity being evaluated in the assessment, helps define the boundaries of evaluation coverage\n\n### Exposure Information\n- **Exposure Category**: Classification of the type of security exposure (Software Vulnerability, Control Gap, Threat Detection)\n- **Assessment Category**: Classification system for organizing types of risks (Endpoint Exposure, Software Exposure)\n- **Assessment Severity**: Importance rating from Critical to Low\n- **Assessment Weightage**: Coefficient (1-10) determining contribution to overall scoring\n\n### Status & Lifecycle\n- **Activity Status**: Current operational state (active/inactive)\n- **Temporal Information**: First found, last updated dates\n- **Lifecycle Metrics**: Lifetime duration and observation timeline\n- **Recent Activity**: Time elapsed since last activity\n\n### Operational Context\n- **Contributing Module**: Whether assessment contributes to Exposure scoring, Reporting, or both\n- **Scope Definition**: Parameters defining what is evaluated for success/failure determination\n- **Assessment Parameters**: Specific criteria and thresholds for evaluation\n\n### Data Provenance\n- **Origin Count**: Number of data sources contributing to the assessment\n- **Data Feed**: Specific API endpoints providing assessment data\n- **Source Attribution**: Original systems used for assessment evaluation\n\n## Key Features\n\n1. **Comprehensive Control Evaluation**: Assesses security measures across various dimensions and control types\n\n2. **Severity-Based Classification**: Categorizes assessments based on their importance to security and compliance\n\n3. **Flexible Evaluation Framework**: Adapts to different security domains and control types\n\n4. **Weighted Scoring System**: Provides configurable impact on overall security scoring\n\n5. **Multi-source Integration**: Incorporates assessment data from various security tools and platforms\n\n6. **Temporal Tracking**: Maintains historical timeline of assessment changes and updates\n\n7. **Modular Contribution**: Designates whether assessments affect exposure scoring, reporting, or both\n\n8. **Scope Definition**: Clearly defines the boundaries and applicability of each assessment\n\nThis Assessment table functions as the foundation for security evaluation processes, providing the structured criteria needed for identifying security gaps, measuring compliance, and tracking control effectiveness across the organization's environment.\n\nIMPORTANT: Query: Show assessments with critical severity, filter for assessment will be 'assessment_severity = Critical' because the filter restricts assessments to only critical ones. End user assessment is a filter.\n",

It captures key attributes such as assessment ID (e.g., AST-01-01), title, description, severity classification, and exposure category. Each assessment defines evaluation criteria for identifying security gaps, measuring compliance, and assessing risk posture across various domains including endpoint security, software vulnerabilities, and control implementation. Assessments maintain lifecycle information from creation through updates and include configurable weightage that determines their contribution to overall security scoring.

It includes attributes such as assessment ID (uniquely formatted as AST-xx-xx), assessment title, detailed description, and classification information. Each assessment is categorized by type and exposure category, providing context about the security domain being evaluated.  \n\nSeverity attributes help prioritize assessment importance. These include assessment severity ratings (Critical to Low) that classify the assessment based on its significance to security and compliance posture. Assessment weightage values (between 1 and 10) determine how much the assessment contributes to overall security scoring, with higher values indicating greater impact.  \n\nAssessments maintain temporal information tracking their lifecycle from creation through updates, including activity status and last active dates. They define specific scopes that establish the boundaries of evaluation of the assessment.  \n\nThe Assessment entity serves as the foundation for generating findings when security issues are identified. It aggregates information from various security tools and data sources, creating a structured approach to security evaluation across the organization.  \n\nIn addition, the Assessment entity includes specific quantitative attributes:  \n\n- Count of Origin: The total count of data sources that contribute to the assessment evaluation process.  \n- Assessment Weightage: Numerical value between 1 and 10 that determines the assessment's contribution to overall security scoring.  \n- Recent Activity: Number of days since the assessment was last updated or evaluated.  \n- Lifetime: Duration in days that the assessment has been active in the system.  \n    - When a user queries for maximum, minimum, highest, lowest, or filtered values (e.g., greater than or less than) related to the above quantitative attributes, results should focus only on the Assessment entity without including other entities for that specific part of the query. However, for other aspects of the query, additional entities may be included as needed. \n    - The above quantitative attributes should not be used when calculating the total count of assessments to avoid redundancy and we dont have *sum* operation support.\n\n",
